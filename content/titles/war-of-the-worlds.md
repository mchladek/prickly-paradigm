Bruno Latour is best known for his work in the cultural study of science. In this pamphlet he turns his attention to another worthy pursuit: the project of peace. As one might expect, Latour gives us a radically different picture of this project than Kant or the *philosophes*, asserting that the West has been in a constant state of war both with other cultures and its ownâ€”although unwittingly so. Read through the lens of his trademark take on "the modern," his arguments are original, thoughtful, and, as usual, provocative.
