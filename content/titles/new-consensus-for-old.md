Thomas Frank has been sending wake-up calls to just about everyone within reach over the past decade, in venues from *The Village Voice* to *Harper's*. His takes on labor politics, advertising, the virtues of the Midwest, and how un-cool you really are have won him a wide audience, and in this piece, Frank gives us a reading of cultural studiesâ€”viewed by some as an important new perspective in the academy, but by others as an unwieldy theoretical fad.
