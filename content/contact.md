## Manuscript Submissions

Authors interested in submitting manuscripts for consideration should initially send a 1,000-word proposal to the editor, preferably in the body of an e-mail, to <info@prickly-paradigm.com>. The proposal should detail the topic and main argument of the piece. It should also include a list of potential audiences and marketing considerations. If a proposal is successful, the Press will then ask to review the manuscript in its entirety. Unsolicited full-length manuscripts will not be considered.

Authors are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with one or more of our existing publications before submitting a proposal. Please also keep in mind when preparing a proposal and/or manuscript:

- We do not generally publish manuscripts over 30,000 words
- We do not publish manuscripts with extensive citations and footnotes
- We do not publish fiction
