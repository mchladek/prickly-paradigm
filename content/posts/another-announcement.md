Be on the lookout in the early spring, 2021, for our newest title, by James Ferguson, *Presence and Social Obligation: An Essay on the Share*. “This is not an essay about COVID-19,” Jim writes. True. And yet. Fantastic work from one of anthropology’s most incisive minds about how we need to be there for one another, and with one another. Nothing less than a rethinking of the social.
