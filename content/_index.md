# Prickly Paradigm Press

### **Marshall Sahlins, December 27, 1930 - April 5, 2021**

##### Founding Publisher of Prickly Paradigm Press.

##### Our Teacher. Our Mentor. Our Dear Friend. 

##### His last prickly quip, shared with us on April 1st: "Prickly Paradigm: The press you cannot suppress."

##### As we mourn his loss, we also renew our commitment to Marshall's paradigm: the unconventional, the rigorously anthropological, the radical and perpetual prickliness. 

##### The work thus continues. 

##### Vale and Rest in Peace, Marshall.
